Today's a bust, the only thing I can call an accomplishment (outside work) was winning a game of Dominion.

I'm still struggling to make my Blender model a manifold mesh. This time the EZ button ("Make Manifold" in 3D printing plugin) just covers
up my debossed text with a face. My options appear to be swear at my
computer, watch hours of tutorials or get enough sleep tonight. I choose the latter.
