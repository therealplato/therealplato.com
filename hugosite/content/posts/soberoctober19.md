Nothing impressive to report after a long workday followed by a long nap.

I caved and bought some rice krispy treat flavored ecig juice with 0% nicotine.

Over the upcoming [long weekend](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/new-zealand/labour-day) I plan to continue work on my
`subverse.Identity` code. I'd like to implement grouping a set of identities as children of a parent identity, defining your own alias
identities that point to other people, and implement "trust tiers" (trust spheres?  trust layers? terrace of trust?) towards the eventual
goal of applying infohygiene policies to those tiers.

_My password backups may be shared with Self and Spouse only_  
_My party photos may be shared with my Close Friends tier and higher_  
_My CV may be shared with the Non-Anonymous tier_  
_This blog post has no restrictions_
