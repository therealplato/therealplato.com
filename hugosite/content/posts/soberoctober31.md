I've updated [`timez`](https://github.com/therealplato/timez) to support user defined timezone aliases.

This might be helpful if you have family or colleagues in different timezones:

```

With #soberoctober ending I look forward to once again sucking at Rocket League and various other games. Steam has re-downloaded 25Gb (yeah, I uninstalled Steam on
day 1) and has 100Gb to go. Half of that is Middle Earth: Shadow Of Mordor.

Nicotine was the hardest to give up, followed by videogames.

My colleagues and I plan to build a Cube out of all those magic cards I bought. 

Cube is a casual format where you and your friends craft 
a pool of several hundred unique cards, then any time you want, randomly pick 3x15 cards from the pool and have a booster draft. You replace
the cards after the draft. You try and build your cube to have an interesting set of themes that's fun to draft - it's like your own custom Magic set. It also offers a way for friends to play, who would rather not spend money on small pieces of cardboard.
