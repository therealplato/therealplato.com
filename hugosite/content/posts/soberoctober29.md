Nothing of note to report today... granted, plenty of previous posts have reported nothing of note in detail.

Did some housekeeping activities in preparation for upcoming travel and started reading [The Rise And Fall Of DODO](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075825-the-rise-and-fall-of-d-o-d-o?from_search=true).

I admit to counting down the 2 remaining days of #soberoctober.

I have not yet broken the rules.

I'm up to 100 daily kettlebell swings.
