Today's project: Make a 3D Printable STL file!

I don't have a 3D printer but a colleague just got one and has kindly offered to collaborate if I give him an STL.

I know that's a filetype of 3D models but I've never made one. Time to figure it out.

### [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)

* Learned to trace a [rastered image](/images/emoji-stop.png) into [svg](/images/emoji-stop.svg) by placing and modifying bezier curve handles
* Learned to set fill of a closed path (took an [embarrassingly long time](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/99608))

### [Blender](https://blender.org)

* Learned to set an object's pivot center
* Learned to import and extrude an SVG
* Learned to convert curve to mesh
* Learned the boolean difference modifier
* Learned what a "manifold mesh" is (but not how to fix it)
* Learned that some 3D printers consider Y axis to be vertical

Figuring out the above and producing [this stl](/misc/handblock.stl) took ~3 hours.
