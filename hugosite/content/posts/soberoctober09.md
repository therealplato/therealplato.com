Today's project: Make a 3D Printable STL file!

I don't have a 3D printer but a colleague just got one and has kindly offered to collaborate if I give him an STL.

I know that's a filetype of 3D models but I've never made one. Time to figure it out.

## Achievements
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)
  * Learned to trace a rastered image into svg by placing and modifying bezier curve handle
  * Learned to fill a closed path
* [Blender](https://blender.org)
  * Learned to set an object's pivot center
  * Learned to import and extrude an SVG
  * Learned to convert curve to mesh
  * Learned the boolean difference modifier
  * Learned what a "manifold mesh" is (but not how to fix it)
  * Learned that some 3D printers consider Y axis to be vertical

Here's my progress after 3.5 hours (and my [stl](/handblock.stl):)
