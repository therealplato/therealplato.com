## Wut?
[Joe Rogan Experience #1007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjegWo2oPVg)
introduced the Sober October challenge. I realized I couldn't remember the last
time I went a week without a beer. I'm certainly dependent on nicotine, I wonder
if I am dependent on alcohol? Let's find out. 

## Goal:
Produce something useful each day this month instead of getting drunk and
[sucking at rocket league.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu_DmCLVKgQ)

## Rules: 
Caffiene is allowed.

Every other psychoactive substance is disallowed including nicotine and alcohol.

Video games are disallowed.

Challenge begins 2017-10-01 00:00:00 and ends 2017-11-01 00:00:00, New Zealand time.

## Today's Achievements
I identified why I smell mold at night - the underside of my wood-slatted futon
frame is covered in mold. It joins my moldy clothing, keyboard, oculus rift and
passport in the ranks of "shit damaged by my moldy Auckland flat."

I continued the Sisyphean task of configuring my Arch Linux machine. Previously
I was using [zeit/hyper](zeit/hyper) but it irritatingly intercepts `^R` and
"refreshes" the terminal, ruining shell history search and vim's redo.

I'm now using
[Swordfish90/cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term)
which brings back fantastically nostalgic memories of the first computer I ever
used, a Kaypro II.
