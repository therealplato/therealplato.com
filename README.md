You can probably skip to [posts](https://github.com/therealplato/therealplato.com/tree/master/hugosite/content/posts) or their result [therealplato.com](http://therealplato.com).

Unless you're interested in my [`hugo`](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) tooling. Then, see also the repo this one generates: [`therealplato/therealplato.github.io`](https://github.com/therealplato/therealplato.github.io)
